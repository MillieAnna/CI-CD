# Weather App Swift â€“ CI/CD Project

This is a simple weather app built using SwiftUI with MVVM architecture.  
The app shows real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and allows users to search for different cities.

This project is used to practice **CI/CD pipeline implementation** using GitHub Actions.


## CI/CD

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that runs on every push or pull request.  
The pipeline does the following:

- Checkout code  
- Install dependencies  
- Build the app  
- (Optional) Run tests
